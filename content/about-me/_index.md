Computer Science and Mathematics student at University of Edinburgh. Graduating in the Year 2023 (hopefully)

Interested in all thing Computers, Algebra and Security. 

I am into CTFs and enjoy learning about Cybersecurity as a hobby. As there is nothing more rewarding than picking things apart and exploiting something the way it wasn't intended. I am a longtime Cryptography enjoyer and now actively learning about pwn(binary exploitation) and reverse engineering.

I also enjoy programming, and working on personal projects. Some of the languages I am confident include : **Python, Sagemath, C, x86, java, rust, haskell, agda**.

You can also find me spending too time on challenge website like : 
- [Cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org/user/thrypuro/)
- [pwn.college](https://dojo.pwn.college/)
- RET2 Labs wargames  
- HacktheBox

When I am not in front of a terminal, I enjoy playing video-games, cycling, ocassionally going to the gym and reading fantasy-fiction
