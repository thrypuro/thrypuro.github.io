### [TopBFT](https://github.com/thrypuro/top-BFT) 
Bryzatine Fault Tolerance scheme that uses Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). My implementation now uses the now broken Intel SGX library to implement both stuff in and outside the enclave. The Distributed system itself is very barebones.

### [puroboy](https://github.com/thrypuro/puro_boy_rs) 
A working z80 cpu implementation written in rust, meant to be a part of a full gameboy emulator. It parses a json with opcodes and information about the instruction then it executes the instruction. The GPU still needs to be written. (I really need to finish this)

## [CTF challenges](https://github.com/thrypuro/my-ctf-challenges)
A collection of CTF challenges I made for my cybersecurity society while I was in University of Edinburgh.
